    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-08-25</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Stratus</strong> (“we”, “us”) handles information when you use our locally run integration that connects to QuickBooks Online (“QBO”).</p>

    <h2>1. What We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Authentication tokens:</strong> We store a QuickBooks Online OAuth refresh token (and transient access tokens) on the local machine where you run the software.</li>
      <li><strong>Operational logs (optional):</strong> If you enable logging, log files are stored locally to help troubleshoot errors.</li>
      <li><strong>No marketing data:</strong> We do not collect analytics, advertising identifiers, or usage profiles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Solely to authenticate with QuickBooks Online and perform the actions you initiate (e.g., reading or creating accounting records).</p>

    <h2>3. Where Data Is Stored</h2>
    <p>All tokens and any generated files are stored locally on your machine (or a path you configure). We do not transmit them to our servers because we do not operate any servers for this app.</p>

    <h2>4. Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share personal information with third parties. Data may be shared only with QuickBooks Online/Intuit to perform the requested operations via their API, under their terms.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We recommend storing secrets in your OS keychain/credential vault or environment variables with appropriate file permissions.</li>
      <li>Rotate/refresh tokens as needed and do not commit them to source control.</li>
      <li>Use unique machine accounts with least-privilege access in QBO.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>Tokens and local files remain on your machine until you delete them. You can revoke the app’s access from QuickBooks Online and delete the token file to remove access immediately.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Data</h2>
    <p>Our software is intended for business use and is not directed to children.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Effective date.”</p>

    <h2>9. Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions or requests: <a href="mailto:solvewiseab@gmail.com">solvewiseab@gmail.com</a></p>
